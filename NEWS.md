This update contains several major changes, include:

* document and sentence ids now start at 1

* download function checks and warns if Java files
are already downloaded

* table joins inside of get_document() no longer 
produce verbose output

for whether sentence ROOTS should be returned

* the speed parameter to init_coreNLP() has been
renamed as anno_level
